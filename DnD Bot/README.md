# DnD Scribe Helper
This is a discord bot that was made as a joke but might end up being developed to help manage DnD discord communities

## How to use
In the files the bot is based it you currently need a config.json with the token and prefix fields.
You also need an Assets folder with a png inside names degenaracy.png
Not very sophisticated right now.
